# Description

The purpose of this application is to keep track of all the items created on an e-commerce website. Using Node Js, and SQL, the user can individually see each category, product, and tag through the backend. Additionally, information can be added, modified, and deleted.

# Installation

First, make sure you have Node.js installed. [Click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node JS. Then install [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize), [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express). To install the packages, in the console, type

```
npm i
```

# Usage

To start the application, first copy the schema from the db folder and paste it into MySQL workbench, then in the terminal on your editor run

```
npm run seed
```
This will seed the tables and their data to be ready to use for checking the routes. Run the server by running
```
npm run start
```
